<h2>My website is all about dogs</h2>

<p>I <strong>love</strong> dogs! I've had <em><b>three</b></em> dogs in my lifetime and their names are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><h3 style="color: blue;">Micky</h3></li>

<p>Micky was my first.<br> I found her wondering the park by herself and took her in. <br> A few of her favorite things are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Going on walks</li>
    <li>Carrots</li>
    <li>Chicken</li>
  </ul>

  <li><h3 style="color: pink;">Po</h3></li>

<p>Po was my second. <br> He was Micky's son and I named him after the panda in <i>Kung Fu Panda</i>.<br> Po likes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Beef</li>
    <li>Oranges</li>
    <li>Cuddles</li>
  </ul>

  <li><h3 style="color: orange;">Pumpkin</h3></li>
  
<p>Pumpkin is my current dog. <br> She's staying with my boyfriend in California right now.<br>Pumpkins <em>loves</em>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Playing fetch</li>
    <li>Eating everything</li>
    <li>Sleeping in</li>
  </ul>
</ol>
