  <p>This is a simple Tortilla Pizza recipe that was originally posted to <a href="https://cookieandkate.com/simple-tortilla-pizzas/" target="_blank">cookieandkate.com.</a></p>
 
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 whole wheat tortilla (or whole wheat pita bread)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup sauce (marinara, pesto, olive oil and garlic, barbecue sauce)</li>
    <li>1/3 cup or less shredded/crumbled cheese (mozzarella, cheddar, goat, feta)</li>
    <li>Toppings (go wild!)</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
</li>
    <li>Place the tortilla in a 12-inch cast iron pan (see notes on baking surfaces below). Spread sauce evenly across the tortilla, leaving 1/2 inch around the edges. Sprinkle with cheese and toppings.
</li>
    <li>Bake for 12-14 minutes, until the cheese is golden and bubbling (no sooner!) and the edges of the tortilla are lightly browned. Slice and serve.
</li>
  </ol>
  
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>If you don’t have a cast iron skillet I highly recommend getting one, but you can use an oven-safe baking rack or bake it directly on the rack of your toaster oven instead. Bake at 400 degrees for 8 to 11 minutes. Do not use a regular baking sheet because the bottom of the tortilla will not get crispy, your cheese will slide right off and you’ll wish you ordered out.<p>

<p>Although I have not tried it personally, Kim tried making tortilla pizzas in her cast iron skillet on a gas grill and said they turned out great!</p>
<p>Make sure to check the ingredients list on the whole wheat tortillas. It should list about 5 ingredients, not 25. I buy mine at health food stores and store them in the fridge or freezer and they almost never go bad.</p>

  <h2>Topping ideas:</h2>

<p>As shown: barbecue sauce (trust me), fresh mozzarella and sharp cheddar cheese, chopped red onion, sliced fresh jalapeño, fresh or defrosted frozen pineapple (canned pineapple is not as good).</p>
<p>Basil pesto, feta, fresh or roasted bell peppers (jarred is fine), sliced kalamata olives, chopped red onion, sliced cherry tomatoes.</p>
<p>Arugula pesto, basil pesto or light marinara sauce, mozzarella (optional), fresh arugula and parmesan shavings added after baking (like this).</p>
<p>Red pepper pesto and goat cheese.
  Anything you want!</p>
